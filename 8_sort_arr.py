# This code is used to sort the array 
# Taking an array as input
nums = list(map(int, input('Enter space separated numbers: ').split()))

# Sorting the array using the inbuilt list method
nums.sort()

# Printing the result
print(nums)

# There are a total of five sorting algorithms that I need to learn
# - Bubble sort
# - Merge sort
